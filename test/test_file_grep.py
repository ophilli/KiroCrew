"""Tests for /api/file-grep — the side-panel Files rail's content search.

Three properties carry the endpoint, and each has its own class below:

1. **Gating.** The root goes through the same ``_validate_dashboard_path`` /
   ``is_sensitive_path`` chokepoint every other handler in ``files.py`` uses, and
   a hit is filtered by ``is_sensitive_path`` again on the way out — so a
   credential store is unreachable whichever engine ran.
2. **Engine parity.** ripgrep and the python fallback must answer the SAME tree
   the same way. They are separate implementations of one contract, and a host
   without ``rg`` must not get a different search.
3. **Budgets.** A result cap and a wall-clock deadline both report ``truncated``,
   and the document pass reports ``skipped_docs`` rather than silently omitting
   documents it never reached.

The document fixtures are built by hand (a ZIP holding the XML parts a parser
reads) so the suite needs no authoring library and no
binary fixture committed to the repo.
