"""Runner adapters: TaskRunner steps and workflow agent calls as taskq rows.

The subagent entry writes a row before it acknowledges a spawn, defers it
under memory pressure instead of refusing, and claims it under a lease when a
slot frees (``subagent_manager/admission/``). The two other entry points
that start agent turns -- a TaskRunner step (``task_executor.execute_task``)
and a workflow ``ctx.agent()`` call (``workflows/agent_pool.py``) -- run on
``SessionManager`` sessions, not on ``SubagentManager.spawn``, so they cannot
reuse that code path literally. This module gives them the same CONTRACT over
the same store:

* :class:`RunnerLane` -- one execution gate bounded by the live effective cap.
  It is the "equivalent hook" the adaptive controller (RFC §5.2) needs for the
  runner entries: the cap it reads IS the controller's clamp, a raise arrives as
  :meth:`RunnerLane.pump`, and ``mode=fixed`` pins the bound. Waiters are FIFO
  and hold nothing but a future.
* :class:`RunnerAdmission` -- ``accept`` (write-before-ack; a failed write is a
  refusal, never an id), ``admit`` (defer on pressure, then a lane slot, then
  ``TaskStore.claim`` under a lease), and the :class:`Admitted` handle the
  runner drives: ``running`` / ``progress`` / ``renew`` / ``settle``,
  ``recovering`` for a turn that ended on a non-success stop reason, and the
  two waits a step can enter -- ``yield_dependency`` (a dependency signal parks
  the row in ``waiting_dependency`` and the lane slot is released until the
  coordinator wakes it) and ``waiting_input`` (a terminal question).
* :func:`adopt_orphaned_rows` -- the recovery adapter for the rows the boot
  reconciler could only stamp ``awaiting_adapter``: a run whose interrupted
  step is safe to retry is resumed from the runner's own checkpoint; one whose
  step may have had a side effect is settled ``unknown_side_effect`` and left
  for a human, never re-run blind. It also ends the ``queued`` rows a dead
  incarnation accepted but never claimed -- these kinds have no dispatcher, so
  nothing else would ever look at them again.

Lanes follow RFC §13 Q5: a run launched by a cron or a hook queues in the
``system`` lane; anything else queues under the session that launched it.

Specification: ``docs/system-specs/modules/taskq.md`` (§ Runner adapters),
``taskrunner.md``, ``workflows.md``.
