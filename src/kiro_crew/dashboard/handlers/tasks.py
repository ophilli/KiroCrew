"""HTTP routes over the durable task queue (``taskq``) and its capacity view.

The dashboard's "Tasks & capacity" panel and ``kirocrew doctor``-style probes
read here. Four routes:

* ``GET /api/tasks`` -- rows from the task store, filterable by ``state`` and
  ``lane``, capped by ``limit``.
* ``GET /api/tasks/summary`` -- queue depth by state, the oldest wait, the
  effective caps per lane against the user's ceiling (from
  ``resource_status.adaptive_state()`` and the session-health cap sources),
  the degrade reason, per-slot wait reasons and recovery attempts.
* ``GET /api/tasks/{task_id}`` -- one row plus its ``task_events`` tail.
* ``POST /api/tasks/{task_id}`` -- an action on a PARKED runner row:
  ``{"action": "answer_input", "answer": "..."}`` delivers the operator's
  answer to a ``waiting_input`` TaskRunner / workflow row (never auto-answered
  anywhere else); ``{"action": "cancel_wait"}`` ends the wait of a row that
  holds no live runtime without an answer (the row is ``cancelled``, the parked
  coroutine resumes and stops). A row whose runtime is live (``starting`` /
  ``running``) has no wait to end and is refused 409 ``not_waiting``: ending
  one here would leave the executor running against a ``cancelled`` row, the
  orphan the route below exists to avoid. That refusal is the STORE's, over the
  generation the handler's read returned (``TaskStore.cancel(only_from=)``), so
  a row a concurrent admission takes live between the read and the write is
  refused too, with the same code and the row's fresh state.
* ``POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/cancel`` -- cancel through the owner that can
  actually stop the work: subagent rows go through ``SubagentManager.cancel``
  (``_unqueue`` / ``taskq_cancel_queued`` for a row that never started,
  ``_force_reap`` → ``taskq_settle`` for a live one, children first); a
  TaskRunner step or workflow agent-call row that is parked (queued, deferred
  or in a wait) is ended through ``RunnerAdmission.cancel_wait``, and one whose
  runtime is live cancels its run (``TaskRunner.cancel`` /
  ``WorkflowService.cancel``) -- a step is one unit of its run, there is no
  smaller lever. The handler never writes the store for a live row itself: a
  bare ``store.cancel`` would leave a live runtime running against a row that
  says ``cancelled``.

Every store read runs in ``asyncio.to_thread`` (SQLite on the request path is
blocking I/O). Auth is the dashboard's token middleware, like every sibling
handler in this package -- there is no per-route check here, and the routes
are NOT on the internal-path lists, so an MCP caller with only the internal
secret is refused the same way it is for ``/api/sessions/health``.

The lane spelling is ``taskq.lanes`` (RFC Q5): the row's stored ``lane``
column when the accept path filed it, else derived -- cron and hook roots and
automation session keys share one ``system`` lane; every other root is keyed
by its own session key.
